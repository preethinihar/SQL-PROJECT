# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis using SQL and Python

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates SQL skills through the analysis of student exam data.
It uses **MySQL** for data storage and querying, and optionally **Python** for automation.

## 🧩 Features
- Create and populate a student performance database
- Run SQL queries to analyze:
  - Average marks by subject
  - Top-performing students
  - Gender-based performance comparison
  - Ranking of students using window functions
- (Optional) Connect database to Python for automated insights

## 🛠️ Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / SQLite)
- Python 3
- Power BI (optional for visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Run the SQL file in MySQL Workbench or DBeaver:
   ```sql
   SOURCE student_performance.sql;
   ```
2. View results for each query section.
3. (Optional) Run `python_script.py` to connect and print analysis results.
